HomeSnitch presents a feasible building block for enhanced transparency and access control for end-users by classifying smart home device communication by their semantic behaviors. Software-defined networking is used to monitor client-server communication and classify device behaviors. This approach enables HomeSnitch to ensure the security of encrypted data and proprietary protocols being utilized throughout smart home devices. Overall, HomeSnitch proved to provide an accurate means of labeling device behavior and defining policies to alert users of potential malicious attacks.
